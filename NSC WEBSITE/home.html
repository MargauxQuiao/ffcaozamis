            <h3>Educational system</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Firm Foundation Christian Academy has an educational system that is quite different in its approach to learning. It is INDIVIDUALIZED, which means the system is constructed in such a way that a student would be given maximum attention. In fact practically all their needs would be addressed since the system is built in such a way that a tutorial-type of approach is provided.

               <br><br> Its educational system is also built upon the BIBLICAL PRINCIPLES. The Word of God is not a subject to be taken up in school but is integrated into all the subjects through stories, cartoon strips, bible memory verses, and pop outs. All these are geared towards building the character and spirituality of the student as this definitely plays a vital role in the students’ future.
                
               <br><br> The educational system is also HIGHLY MOTIVATIONAL. Gold stars, silver stars, rewards, prizes, privileges, free time in the computer, congratulation slips, and many others awards are given to any student who does his work well. 
                
               <br><br> MASTERY IN LEARNING is also built in the system. The slowest student when finished with the years curriculum will have learned exactly like what the fastest student has learned. Because the students go at their own pace, according to their comprehension and ability to work with their materials.
                
               <br><br> The system also teaches the student to SET ACHIEVABLE GOALS which is essential in his future success in life. Lastly, the educational system utilizes multimedia and computer technology beginning with students in the first grade level.
